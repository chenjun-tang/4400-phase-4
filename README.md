A web DBMS application of covid testing based on MySQL

For this application, we mainly developed using Flask based on Python and MySql.

To run this application, we simply cd into the file in the terminal and run command 'python3 app.py'. Then we can click into the link provided by python to open our web app (You will have to install flask packages first). So we use Flask to implement the logics of web pages and to connect the web app to mysql.
